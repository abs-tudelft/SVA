# SVCall

SVCall is a scalable, parallel and efficient implementation of next generation sequencing data pre-processing and variant calling workflows. Our design tightly integrates most pre-processing workflow stages, using Spark built-in functions to sort reads by coordinates, and mark duplicates efficiently. A cluster scaled DeepVariant for both CPU-only and CPU+GPU clusters is also integrated. 

## Apache Arrow Dependencies
 - [C++ libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp)
 - [C bindings using GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/c_glib)
 - [Plasma Object Store](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/cpp/src/plasma): a
   shared-memory blob store, part of the C++ codebase
 - [Python libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/python)

## Installation Requirements
 - Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
 - Apache Spark 3.0.1

## Configuration & Build


## How to run 
1. Install [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/) container
2. Download our Singularity [script](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/arrow-gen/tree/master/Singularity) and generate singularity image (this image contains all Arrow related packges necessary for building/compiling BWA-MEM)
3. Now enter into generated image using command:
         
        sudo singularity shell <image_name>.simg
